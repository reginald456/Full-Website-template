                    <p>1. <b>Espresso (Short Black)</b>

The espresso (aka “short black”) is the foundation and the most important part to every espresso based drink. So much so that we’ve written a guide on how to make the perfect espresso shot. But for the purposes of this post an espresso consists of:

• 1 Shot of espresso in an espresso cup</p>

                    <p>2. <b>Double Espresso (Doppio)</b>

A double espresso (aka “Doppio”) is just that, two espresso shots in one cup. Therefore a double espresso consists of:

• 2 shots of espresso in an espresso cup</p>

                    <p>3. <b>Short Macchiato</b>

A short macchiato is similar to an espresso but with a dollop of steamed milk and foam to mellow the harsh taste of an espresso. You will find that baristas in different countries make short macchiatos differently. However the traditional way of making a short macchiato is as follows:

• 1 Shot of espresso in a short glass or espresso cup
• A dollop of steamed milk and foam placed on top of the espresso</p>

                    <p>4. <b>Long Macchiato</b>

A long macchiato is the same as a short macchiato but with a double shot of espresso. The same rule of thirds applies in the traditionally made long macchiato:

• 2 shots of espresso in a tumbler glass or cup
• A dollop of steamed milk and foam placed on top of the espresso</p>

                   

                    <p>5. <b>Ristretto</b>

A ristretto is an espresso shot that is extracted with the same amount of coffee but half the amount of water. The end result is a more concentrated and darker espresso extraction. It is made as follows:

• Extract a standard espresso shot with half the amount of water.
• Alternatively turn off a normal espresso extraction before the espresso starts to blonde.</p>

                    <p>6. <b>Long Black (Americano)</b>

A long black (aka “americano”) is hot water with an espresso shot extracted on top of the hot water. It is made as follows:

• Fill a cup with 2/3rds full of hot water
• Extract 1 shot of espresso over the hot water</p>

                    

                    <p>7. <b>Café Latte</b>

A café latte, or “latte” for short, is an espresso based drink with steamed milk and micro-foam added to the coffee. This coffee is much sweeter compared to an espresso due to the steamed milk. It is made as follows:

• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a tumbler glass
• Add steamed milk
• 1cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk</p>

                    

                    <p>8. <b>Cappuccino</b>

A cappuccino is similar to a latte. However the key difference between a latte and cappuccino is that a cappuccino has more foam and chocolate placed on top of the drink. Further a cappuccino is made in a cup rather than a tumbler glass. It is made as follows:

• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a cup
• Add steamed milk
• Add 2-3cm of micro-foam on top of the steamed milk
• Sprinkle chocolate on top of the coffee</p>

                  

                    <p>9. <b>Flat White</b>

A flat white is a coffee you’ll primarily find in Australia and New Zealand. It is made the same as a cappuccino expect it does not have any foam or chocolate on top. It is made like this:

• 1 shot of espresso into a cup
• Add steamed milk into the cup but no micro-foam</p>

                    <p>10. <b>Piccolo Latte</b>

A piccolo latte is a café latte made in an espresso cup. This means it has a very strong but mellowed down espresso taste thanks to the steamed milk and micro foam within it. There are two ways of making a piccolo latte, with either 1 espresso shot or 1 ristretto shot:

• 1 shot of espresso or 1 ristretto shot of espresso in a espresso cup
• Add steamed milk and small amount of micro-foam.</p>

<p>11. <b>Mocha</b>

A mocha is a mix between a cappuccino and a hot chocolate. It is made by putting mixing chocolate powder with an espresso shot and then adding steamed milk and micro-foam into the beverage. The steps are as follows:

• Extract 1 shot of espresso into a cup
• Add one spoon of chocolate powder into the espresso shot and mix
• Add steamed milk
• Add 2-3cm of micro-foam
• Sprinkle chocolate powder on top

</p>

<p>12. <b>Affogato</b>

An affogato is a simple dessert coffee that is treat during summer and after dinner. It is made by placing one big scoope of vanilla ice cream within a single or double shot of espresso:

• Add one scoop of vanilla ice-cream into a tumbler glass milk
• Pour a single or double shot of espresso over the vanilla ice-cream

Barista Tip: If you feel like an irish kick add a shot of Frangelico liqueur into the mix.</p>
